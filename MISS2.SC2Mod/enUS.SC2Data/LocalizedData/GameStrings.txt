Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1515=In case you ARE real, someone out there has been messing with my harvesting bots. Would you mind keeping an eye on them for me?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1516=Hi, commanders! I thought everyone had forgotten about me out here. The hallucinations are the only visitors I've had.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1517=I guess that's terrazine for you. Speaking of, someone's been destroying my harvesting bots. Could you provide an escort for them?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1518=Welcome to the jungle, Commanders! Hope you like fun and games! Long term exposure to terrazine provides plenty of both! Trust me!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1519=Someone out there is making a game of destroying my bots, though. They're ruining my research! I need you to guard those bots!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1520=Looks like a geyser's about to become active! One of my bots will depart for it shortly.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1521=The first geyser should be opening up soon. I'll send a bot out for it when it does.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1522=Ooh, I've located a soon-to-be active geyser. Make sure to escort the bot I'll send to harvest it!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1523=Bel'shir says that some more geysers are opening up soon. Don't worry if you can't hear her. She only talks to me.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1524=More geysers are gonna be active soon. Don't ask how I know that. I just... do.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1525=Do you hear that? It's the terrazine moving beneath the surface. Ooh, more geysers are on the way.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1526=Hmm, looks like there will be more geysers soon. You can always count on Bel'shir to provide what you need!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1527=Seismic activity detected! That can only mean one thing: more geysers!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1528=If I were a betting man, I'd put money on more geysers showing up soon. If, you know, I had any money.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1529=Some geysers are gonna be opening in a few moments. My bots can smell them!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1530=You know what I'm about to say, right, eh? That there are more geysers on the way? Get out of my head!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1531=The geysers are returning, as foretold by omniscient Bel'shir! Be ready!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1532=These are the last of the geysers! The last of their kind... all alone in the depths of space...
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1533=Looks like these are the last set of geysers. The end is nigh, commanders!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1534=These should be the last of the geysers! And things were just getting interesting.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1535=Hey! Heads up! I'm sending out the first bot. Make sure to protect it! It's my favorite.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1536=Okay, I'm sending a bot to collect the geyser's terrazine. Don't let it get destroyed!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1537=My bot is departing now. It's fully automated, so all you have to do is keep it alive. Yes, it's alive. It's alive! Uh, sorry.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1538=Bots are on their way, commanders! Please keep the little guys out of trouble.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1539=Sending out the best of my bots! Well, the best of what's left, anyway.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1540=My bots really want to get to the terrazine. They're kinda impatient, so I'm letting them out now.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1541=Hey! The bots are leaving, and I didn't even get to pack them a refueling cell!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1542=Bots away! (Laughs at his own joke) What? I thought it was funny. Bel'shir laughs every time I tell it!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1543=I built these bots myself, in a cave, with a box of scraps! So I'd appreciate it if they came back intact.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1544=I think the bots are telling me they're rolling out, but I could be wrong. They've lied to me before, those little miscreants!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1545=There go the bots! (Sniffs) They grow up so fast! Daddy loves you!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1546=My bot is collecting the terrazine now. You'll have to defend it until it's done.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1547=Terrazine collection initiated! It might take a little while, so just sit tight!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1548=Alright, collecting the terrazine now. Keep an eye out for trouble, commanders!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1549=Collection protocol initiated. Soon, all of Bel'shir's terrazine will be mine! Muhahaha!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1550=Starting the collection process. Please be patient, this is a delicate procedure!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1551=Oh benevolent Bel'shir, I humbly ask that you gift me with your terrazine. The commanders have promised to protect it. Right?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1552=Gathering the terrazine now. Remember, commanders: Constant vigilance!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1553=This terrazine is about to become TERRANzine. Bwahaha! What, nothing? Oh come on.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1554=Harvest time! Let's see what our terrazine crop looks like this year.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1555=My bots are taking in the terrazine. It has to be done just right, or else Bel'shir will be angry.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1556=Acquiring the terrazine now. Keep those bots safe, commanders!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1557=The harvesting bot is returning now. You'll have to continue guarding it until it arrives.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1558=The bot is heading back. It's scared, so you should keep it company.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1559=A successful terrazine harvest! Now that bot just has to make it home safely.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1560=Come on home, little bots! The commanders will protect you!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1561=Okay, the bots should be on their way back. I need that terrazine, commanders... for my... experiments.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1562=The bots are returning to me now. I can always count on them to do that. Unlike SOME people.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1563=Terrazine tank is full! My bots are making the return trip now. Don't let them get away from you!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1564=And the race is on! Which bot will make it back to me first? (Whispers) My money's on Gary. He always gets the best oil.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1565=Bots are heading home. They're sheep in need of a shepherd, commanders. And there are a lot of wolves on the prowl.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1566=My bots are heading back to base. Be careful, commanders. It's a jungle out there!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1567=Time for the bots to come back. I hate it when they're out there all night without giving me a call.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1568=They're coming after my bots! Stop them, commanders!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1569=Gah, here come the bad guys! Uh, who are they, again?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1570=I'm picking up some hostile forces headed for my bots. They must really want that terrazine.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1571=Look out, commanders! I'm detecting enemy movement toward the bots!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1572=The enemy clearly intends to attack my bots. Don't, don't, don't let them do that!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1573=Enemies are headed for my bots! What a bunch of jerks!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1574=What's this? Enemy forces en route to my bots? It's just like Bel'shir said!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1575=Oh, that's just great! The enemy is moving toward my bots. I knew I should have put more turrets on those things!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1576=Hostile forces are advancing on my bots! Have they no respect for science!?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1577=I see you, enemy scum! They're going to attack my bots, commanders!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1578=Oh man, they can warp in their forces right next to my bots? I guess I should have expected that from the protoss...
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1579=Oh commanders, the enemy is warping in near the bot! I wish I had that kind of tech...
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1580=They're warping in right next to the bot!? That is totally overpowered!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1581=Incoming enemy drop pods! Which means... (gulps, whispers) They're ABOVE us. Protect the bot!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1582=Enemy drop pods inbound on my bot! The sky is falling! The sky is falling!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1583=They're dropping in right next to my bot! At least they're not smashing into it.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1585=The zerg are dropping down right next to my bot! How many Leviathans do they have up there?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1586=Incoming zerg drop pods! They're headed right for my bot!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1587=What IS that thing? It looks like a Void Thrasher! I didn't know they actually exist!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1588=A Void Thrasher? Here? I thought those were purely theoretical!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1589=No... it can't be... a Void Thrasher!? Please tell me this is another hallucination!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1590=Umm, the Void Thrashers are back! They'll tear my bots apart if you don't stop them!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1591=Oh by the way commanders, there seem to be more Void Thrashers around. Just keeping you informed!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1592=Those Void Thrashers are the stuff of nightmares. Mine, specifically.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1593=Oh wow, is that a hybrid? I haven't seen one in a while! Fascinating!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1594=A hybrid! Does this mean the Dominion perfected the gene splicing tech to create them?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1595=That... looks like a hybrid. From what I remember about them, that is very bad news.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1596=More hybrid on the way. I'd really like a glimpse at their breeding facility's configuration.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1597=These hybrid are different than the ones I've seen before. Any chance I could study them after this?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1598=Hostile hybrid inbound! I wonder how terrazine affects their physiology...
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1599=Hey! Hey, they're attacking my bots! Commanders!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1600=(Sing-song voice) My bots are under attack... My bots are under attack...
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1601=Good morning, commanders! The enemy's eating my bots for breakfast!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1602=What's made to last forever and being destroyed? My bots, of course!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1603=The enemy's attacking my bots! Geez, commanders, can't you keep a hold of aggro!?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1604=Enemy forces have converged on my bots! Everybody, get in there!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1605=Those guys are smashing my bots to pieces! And I really don't wanna pick up after them!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1606=Please, please, please stop the enemy from breaking my stuff!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1607=My bots are taking damage! Terrible, terrible damage!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1608=They already destroyed one of the bots? I'll never get another one to that geyser in time!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1611=The enemy's taken down a bot! The geyser's gonna seal itself before another one reaches it.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1612=Aw man, that bot didn't even reach the geyser! There's no way I can send another one before it's gone.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1618=Hey! I worked hard on that! I need those bots in order to harvest the terrazine, commanders!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1619=Well, there goes one of my bots. If we lose too many of them, I won't be able to harvest any more terrazine!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1620=Okay, that was my favorite bot! (Frustrated grunt) Please try to not lose any more of them, commanders!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1624=What's that noise? Oh, it's just my precious bot going up in flames! One more, and we're toast!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1625=No, no, no! Not my bots! You monsters! We can't lose any more of them, commanders!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1626=Oh, come on! I can't afford to lose any more bots, commanders! They're all I have left!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1627=That's a good little bot! Welcome home! I missed you so much!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1628=The bots are back in town, the bots are back in town! (Makes guitar noises)
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1629=Look, commanders, bots! Oh, those are mine. (Gasps) And they have terrazine!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1630=Good news, commanders! My bots have brought me terrazine! Well, it's good news for me.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1631=Hey uh, great job, commanders! My bots are safe and sound. Do you do this sort of thing often?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1632=Whew! My bots have returned! Looks like I won the bet this time, Bel'shir!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1633=My bots are back! That mean's it's "T" time. (Stage whispers) The "T" is for terrazine!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1634=We've got the start of a good terrazine cache! But my research is going to require some more.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1635=Hmm, looks like we're making progress. It's gonna take more terrazine than that to finish my... uh... research, that's right!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1636=I think I have a little less than half the terrazine I need. I guess I'll be sending out more bots!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1637=My terrazine tanks are about halfway full. Bel'shir's being really generous today! I should really send her a thank you card...
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1638=Are my terrazine tanks are half empty, or half full? Huh. This wouldn't be a problem if they were completely full!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1639=Man, collecting terrazine is hard work. We've only got about half of what I need!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1640=I've got almost all the terrazine I need! Keep it up, commanders!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1641=Just a little more terrazine to go! Our victory is close at hand! (Devious laugh)
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1642=Ooh, look at all that terrazine! And it's all mine! I need just a tiny bit more, commanders.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1643=Noooo! Now I'll never finish my research! Do you have any idea what I've been through on this planet!? Argh!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1644=(Frustrated exertion) It's ruined! It's all ruined! Just like my graduate thesis project!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1645=Yes! I can finally finish this research and get off this godforsaken rock! (Beat) I'm sorry, Bel'shir! I didn't mean it like that!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1646=Research complete. Haha, that was pretty good! I crack me up. But seriously, let's get the hell out of here.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1647=Nice work, commanders! You've done science a great service today. Now uhh... any chance I could get a ride off world?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1648=Oh, what? They're siphoning the terrazine from Bel'shir's fauna! Commanders, try to free it if you can!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1649=This is an outrage! The enemy is draining the terrazine from the Bel'shir gliders! We have to stop them! Or not, your choice.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1650=They're taking terrazine directly out of the majestic Bel'shir gliders! You... might want to stop them if you can, commanders.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1651=Looks like they've trapped another Bel'shir glider. You know what to do or not do, commanders!
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1652=Yeesh, they're really doubling down on this living terrazine extraction plan. Maybe we should put a stop to it?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1653=Another Bel'shir glider is being drained of its terrazine. Do you think you have the time to set it free?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1654=The Bel'shir glider's terrazine won't last forever. If you want to save it, you'll have to do it before it's completely drained.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1655=Uh, we have only a limited amount of time to save the Bel'shir glider's life. Try not to forget about it. Being forgotten sucks.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1656=So, I'm not saying you have to, but if you want to free that Bel'shir glider I mentioned, you don't have all day.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1657=Once the Bel'shir glider's terrazine is gone, it'll be dead. So try to free it sooner than later. If you have a heart, that is.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1658=(Mumbles calculations to himself)By my calculations, the Bel'shir glider is going to die soon. You don't have much time left to save it.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1659=The Bel'shir glider's not long for this world, commanders. You'll miss your chance if you don't save it soon.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1660=Well, you're almost out of time to prevent the Bel'shir glider's death, commanders. If you were ever planning on it, anyway.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1661=The Bel'shir glider is almost dead, commanders. It's now or never. Literally. You could choose either one.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1662=Wow, you really just let that thing die. And I thought I knew you.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1663=Well, that's one dead whale. It was probably endangered, you know.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1664=They drained that creature completely dry! Bel'shir is going to be so mad about this...
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1665=All of that creature's terrazine is gone. And so is its life! Tsk tsk. What a tragedy... just like my career.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1666=You saved it! Bel'shir thanks you, commanders. I mean... I thank you. Yes. Me. With the thanking.
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1667=I can't believe they were extracting terrazine from those things. Why didn't I think of that!?
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1668=Hey um, did you happen to save any of the extracted terrazine? No? Okay... well, that's okay...
Sound/Name/acObj_BelshirScientist_1669=You know, I never noticed those things floating around here before. I wonder where they came from.
